## Active Team {#active-team}

Our awesome team is guided by [M. EL HAJJI](https://github.com/pr-elhajji), the founder who kicked this whole thing off.

Although [M. EL HAJJI](https://github.com/pr-elhajji), [Y. Essaady](https://github.com/essaady), and [T. Ait Baha](https://github.com/tarekai) are currently the only official members of the development team, we're incredibly lucky to have a community of amazing contributors who see the value in this project and actively help drive it forward.

## Student Fellows {#student-fellows}

A handful of students have also worked on Open TurorAI as part of their school term/internship, contributing amazing features such as plugin options validation, and migration tooling.
