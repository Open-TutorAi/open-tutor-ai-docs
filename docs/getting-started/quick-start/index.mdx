:::info **Important Note on User Roles and Privacy:**

- **Admin Creation:** The first account created on Open TutorAI gains **Administrator privileges**, controlling user management and system settings.
- **User Registrations:** Subsequent sign-ups start with **Pending** status, requiring Administrator approval for access.
- **Privacy and Data Security:** **All your data**, including login details, is **locally stored** on your device. Open TutorAI ensures **strict confidentiality** and **no external requests** for enhanced privacy and security.
  - **All models are private by default.** Models must be explicitly shared via groups or by being made public. If a model is assigned to a group, only members of that group can see it. If a model is made public, anyone on the instance can see it.

Choose your preferred installation method below:

- **Docker:** **Officially supported and recommended for most users**
- **Python:** Suitable for low-resource environments or those wanting a manual setup
- **Kubernetes:** Ideal for enterprise deployments that require scaling and orchestration
