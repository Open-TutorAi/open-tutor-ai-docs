## Key Features of Open TutorAI ⭐

- 🚀 **Effortless Setup**: Install seamlessly using Docker, Kubernetes, Podman, Helm Charts (`kubectl`, `kustomize`, `podman`, or `helm`) for a hassle-free experience with support for both `:ollama` image with bundled Ollama and `:cuda` with CUDA support.

- 🛠️ **Guided Initial Setup**: Complete the setup process with clarity, including an explicit indication of creating an admin account during the first-time setup.

- 🤝 **OpenAI API Integration**: Effortlessly integrate OpenAI-compatible APIs for versatile conversations alongside Ollama models. The OpenAI API URL can be customized to integrate Open TutorAI seamlessly with various third-party applications.

- 🛡️ **Granular Permissions and User Groups**: By allowing administrators to create detailed user roles, user groups, and permissions across the workspace, we ensure a secure user environment for all users involved. This granularity not only enhances security, but also allows for customized user experiences, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility amongst users.

- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a seamless experience across desktop PCs, laptops, and mobile devices.

- 📱 **Progressive Web App for Mobile**: Enjoy a native progressive web application experience on your mobile device with offline access on `localhost` or a personal domain, and a smooth user interface. In order for our PWA to be installable on your device, it must be delivered in a secure context. This usually means that it must be served over HTTPS.

  - To set up a PWA, you'll need some understanding of technologies like Linux, Docker, and reverse proxies such as `Nginx`, `Caddy`, or `Traefik`. Using these tools can help streamline the process of building and deploying a PWA tailored to your needs. While there's no "one-click install" option available, and your available option to securely deploy your Open TutorAI instance over HTTPS requires user experience, using these resources can make it easier to create and deploy a PWA tailored to your needs.

Documents can be loaded into the `Documents` tab of the Workspace, after which they can be accessed using the pound key [`#`] before a query, or by starting the prompt with the pound key [`#`], followed by a URL for webpage content integration.

- 🔍 **Web Search for RAG**: You can perform web searches using a selection of various search providers and inject the results directly into your local Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) experience.

- ⚙️ **Concurrent Model Utilization**: Effortlessly engage with multiple models simultaneously, harnessing their unique strengths for optimal responses. Leverage a diverse set of model modalities in parallel to enhance your experience.

- 🔐 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensure secure access with restricted permissions. Only authorized individuals can access your Ollama, while model creation and pulling rights are exclusively reserved for administrators.

- 🌐🌍 **Multilingual Support**: Experience Open TutorAI in your preferred language with our internationalization (`i18n`) support. We invite you to join us in expanding our supported languages! We're actively seeking contributors!
